# GoF Patterns (Gang of Four)

In this project you can find very basic implementations of the OOP patterns described in the 1994 book **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software**.

## Currently implemented patterns

### Creational
- *AbstractFactory* - multiple classes with a shared interface which are responsible for creating families of related objects.
- *Builder* - a class which allows the user to create a complex object.
- *Factory Method* - replaces direct object initialization with a single method. 
- *Prototype* - allows object creation by copying existing objects.
- *Singleton* - provides an object that has only one instance.
